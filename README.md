Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a 𝐟𝐮𝐧 𝐚𝐩𝐩 that combines 𝐃𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐃𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐆𝐨 search, 𝐖𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 summaries, and an advanced language model (𝐏𝐡𝐢3 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥) into a neat little tool using Streamlit!

Here’s how it works:

👉 You ask a question.

👉 The app fetches real-time results from DuckDuckGo and quick summaries from Wikipedia.

👉 It then uses Phi3 Small, a compact yet powerful LLM, to generate a thoughtful, detailed response.

I also added a memory feature so the app remembers your previous questions and responses—like a mini conversation history. 💬

The journey had its fair share of debugging headaches (DuckDuckGo was a bit stubborn 😅), but it was totally worth it! 

Here’s what this app can do:

🔍 Fetch accurate, real-time search results.

📖 Summarize topics with Wikipedia.

🤖 Provide intelligent answers using Phi3 Small.

Excited to share this with you all! If you’ve got suggestions, questions, or ideas, drop them in the comments or DM me. Always happy to connect and geek out over cool tech! 💡
